                <h6>A funny story:</h6>
                <p>When I was little my dad told me to go to the toilet standing up because it's how a "man" should go to the toilet.
                    So I followed his advise and next time I went to the toilet I did it while standing up. So when I was at my grandmothers place
                    I went to the toilet standing up but I forgot I had to poop aswell and you know what happened next.
                    Afterwards my grandmother blamed my dad and I didn't get any scolding at all.
                </p>
                <h6>TL;DR</h6>
                <p>My told me to go the toilet standing up, but I had to poop so it didn't work out well.</p>
